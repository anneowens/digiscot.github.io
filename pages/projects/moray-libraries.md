## Project plan
Get DigITal Clubs will target older people, people with disabilities and job seekers with little or no ICT experience. Participants will undertake a  4 week  (2 hours per week) basic ICT course run by one of our Learning Centre Advisers and then be supported ,to practice their new skills, by volunteers recruited from learners who have: completed one of our accredited courses; or who have declared an interest as a result of our advertising campaign

### Project description
To upskill those in the community to be able fully participate in the digital age.

## Progress
We have made it to the front page of the [Moray Council Internet pages](http://www.moray.gov.uk) and the local press has been very interested in our project and as a result have been filling up places very quickly.
# Publicity
Promotion is going well and our flyers and posters are being circulated around the community. Adverts will soon appear in the local press and our partners are promoting to their clients.

Update June 2015:

So far 45 beginners are signed up to clubs and 6 volunteers have been recruited. 
Update September 2015:
Another 3 people have expressed an interest in volunteering for the project bringing out total number of volunteers to 9.  The take up of the free courses and drop ins is now escalating due to the publicity and promtion that has been doen over the last few week.  We have now had 83 people come along to do the free 4 week course with 35 on the waiting list starting soon.The drop ins are also going well with a total 21 individuals, so far, coming along to get assistance with their Laptops, IPads and Tablets. As word gets around and more people attend we are now seeing peer support developing which is great.

Thanks to Frank (one of our volunteers) We now have a Get DigITal in Moray blog and will be working with learners to populate this over the winter months.  We are busy taking photos for the site.
